# Obsidian Theme Toggler

Toggle the theme individually for each of Obsidian's panels.

## What the plugin does

It adds a theme toggle button to each pane in your workspace, allowing you to set the theme on a _per-panel_ basis. In addition, it adds three commands for toggling the theme. You can explicitly determine whether to toggle the theme, change it to dark, or change it to light.

### Commands

- Theme Toggler: Toggle theme in the active pane
- Theme Toggler: Activate dark mode in the active pane
- Theme Toggler: Activate light mode in the active pane

## Disclaimer

This plugin is provided as is, and is designed for my personal use of Obsidian on macOS. As such it is not thoroughly tested across all operating systems and use cases. It is designed to work the best with the "Default Obsidian" theme.

This plugin modifies some parts of the Obsidian interface, so it may break with future updates. It may also be incompatible with other plugins, bits of custom CSS you have, or the theme you are using.
